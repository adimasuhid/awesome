# Development practices

This is a list of things to prefer and avoid in projects. These practices are a result of trials-and-errors across many Proudcloud projects. We've learned what works and what doesn't, and these are the lessons that stuck.

## Ethics

- Always be online on Slack
- Better to ask forgiveness than permission
- Respect your team and individual schedules
- Always work on targeted release versions or milestones. We use `alpha`, `beta` for early stage projects. Moving forward, practice the use of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).
- Be aware of the product roadmap.
- Work will never run out. Focus on approximately 2 weeks (1 sprint) worth of targets only. Close a version release. Repeat the cycle.
- Conserve energy. Do not overwork yourselves.
- Code clarity. Readable code.
- Consistency with team practices but feel free to discuss improvements.
- Consistency but correct and raise what you feel is wrong.
- Do your best not to be a blocker to your teammates.
- Got a problem? Ask on Slack.

## Starting a new project

- Create a Github repo and make the default branch to `develop`.
- Create and update the project's `README.md`
- Add proper installation instructions. Notes and caveats.
- Github Slack channel integration. The amount of notifications you want to receive depends on you. Usually, we like to get notified with new pull requests and comments only.
- Continuous integration. Currently, we're using [Circleci](https://circleci.com). Ask an organization admin or a collaborator to add it for you if you don't have access. Circleci uses Github authentication so you don't need an invite. Don't forget the Slack integration.

## Watch out
